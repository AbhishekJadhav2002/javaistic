title: Java Program to Multiply Two Integers
shortTitle: Multiply Two Integers
description: In this program, you'll learn to store and multiply two integer numbers in Java. After multiplication, the final value is displayed on the screen.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Java programming topics:

- [Java Operators](/docs/operators)
- [Java Basic Input and Output](/docs/basic-input-output)

## Multiply Two Integers

A Java program that multiply two numbers predefined by the user is as follows:

### Example 1: Program to Multiply Two Integers

```java
class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    System.out.println("Enter two numbers");
    int first = 10;
    int second = 2;

    System.out.println(first + " " + second);

    // multiply two numbers
    int multiplication = first * second;
    System.out.println("Multiplication: " + first + " * " + second + " = " + multiplication);
  }
}
```

#### Output

```text
Enter two numbers
10 2
Multiplication: 10 * 2 = 20
```
Just like the [previous program](/programs/add-two-integers#example-program-to-add-two-integers) of addition,

Then, `first` and `second` are multiplied using the `*` operator, and its result is stored in another variable `multiplication`.

And then, `multiplication` along with some [string concatenation](/docs/basic-input-output#example-print-concatenated-strings) is printed on the screen using `println()` function.


### Example 2: Program to Multiply Two Double

Multiplication can be performed between positive, negative numbers as well,

```java
class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    System.out.println("Enter two numbers");
    double first = -13.0;
    double second = 2.3;

    System.out.println(first + " " + second);

    // multiply two numbers
    double multiplication = first * second;
    System.out.println("Multiplication: " + first + " * " + second + " = " + multiplication);
  }
}
```

#### Output

```text
Enter two numbers
-13.0 2.3
Multiplication: -13.0 * 2.3 = -29.9
```

Datatype of variable `multiplication` is `double`, because the result of multiplying two numbers having data type `double` is `double`.

<TipInfo>

**Note:** Here, the output `multiplication` is negative, because these operations foolow [standard mathematical rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication#Properties).
